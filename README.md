Ninja Store is a very simple Express.js app for you to hack around and uderstand Express better.

It is a good project to start learnig Express because if covers GET and POST requests, the Jade template engine, the Stylus CSS engine, login-logout, and sessions. All of it while being a tiny project.

To run it use `$ DEBUG=ninja-store:* npm start` or if you installed [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) (via `npm install -g nodemon`) use `$ nodemon app`
